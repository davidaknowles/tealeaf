Created `REPO_NOTES.md` with a codebase overview for tealeaf.

Key components documented:

- `tealeaf-map` builds annotation-derived isoform-to-intron and isoform-to-exon
  references.
- `tealeaf-cluster` maps Salmon transcript abundance to intron and exon counts,
  then runs shared cluster refinement.
- `tealeaf-sc` aggregates barcodes into pseudobulk samples, estimates transcript
  abundance from alevin-fry equivalence classes using EM, then reuses the shared
  intron counting and clustering path.
- `tealeaf/shared_functions.py` contains the common cluster construction,
  filtering, refinement, and PSI-ratio calculation logic.
- `tealeaf-ggsashimi` plots tealeaf intron/exon count files with an adapted
  ggsashimi workflow.

Implementation notes:

- Intron representation in the shared clustering code is
  `[start, end, total_count, name, exon_set]`.
- Bulk and single-cell pipelines both converge on `{prefix}count_intron`,
  `{prefix}count_exon`, `{prefix}refined_cluster`, and `{prefix}ratio_count`.
- Potential issues observed: `pyproject.toml` misspells the ggsashimi entry
  point, `cluster_def` is parsed but not passed to `process_clusters()`, and
  `extra_scripts/ccp_gen.py` uses `networkx` without declaring it as a package
  dependency.
