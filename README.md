# tealeaf - Transcript Expression Augmented LEAFcutter

tealeaf combines ideas from [SUPPA](https://doi.org/10.1261/rna.051557.115) and LeafCutter to analyze alternative splicing events by first performing isoform abundance estimation and then collapsing to individual splice events/junctions. This is particularly useful for low coverage samples, e.g. single-cell RNA-seq. 

tealeaf can be installed as a command line tool with `pip install tealeaf`

## Detailed Tutorial to run the tealeaf

In this tutorial, we walk through all the steps to run the tealeaf pipeline. For each step, we discuss the possible parameters that can be changed, how to do so and the considerations involved in each of the parameters. Finally, we show example inputs and outputs of each step (with column explanations) so the user knows what to expect and can make custom files as needed.


### Step 0: Transcriptome annotation download or generation and Salmon isoform quantification

Example human transcriptome annotation can be downloaded from https://www.gencodegenes.org/human/


### Step 1: Isoform to intron map generation

In this step, tealeaf_map_gen will be used to generate a map that contains information about which isoform is generated by splicing which introns. The map will also contain information about which exon is in which isoform. This step only needs to run once for each unique transcriptome annotation gtf file. 

Sample run:
```
python tealeaf_map_gen -a gencode.v45.annotation.gtf --annot_source gencode -o sample_run_ --maxintronlen 5000000 --minintronlen 50 -v False          
```


Depending on the setting, two or four files will be generated.
- {out_prefix}isoform_intron_map.tsv
- {out_prefix}intron_exon_connectivity.tsv
- {out_prefix}isoform_intron_map_with_virtual.tsv
- {out_prefix}intron_exon_connectivity_with_virtual.tsv

where with_virtual means virtual introns were used to capture all annotated AFE and ALE (a testing feature).

if annotation_source='gencode', an additional file will be generated to give out information about the possible isoform type that can be generated by splicing out each intron
- {out_prefix}intron_source_map.tsv (also a testing feature)

  
A record file that contains the parameters will also be generated

When --single_cell == True, five additional files will be generated. Two for sparse matrices in npz format, rows are isoforms, and columns are introns or exons. Three txt files record the row and column names. These files are essential for tealeaf-sc.




### Step 2: Salmon isoform quantification

tealeaf uses the pseudoalignment tool Salmon for bulk and preprocessed pseudobulk data. For usage of Salmon please refer to https://salmon.readthedocs.io/en/latest/salmon.html

For single-cell data, tealeaf uses the alevin-fry pipeline from Salmon. For usage of alevin-fry please refer to https://alevin-fry.readthedocs.io/en/latest/. 
Specific notices, please use -d, --dump-eqclasses flag when using alevin-fry quant to obtain the eqclass matrix. Also, t2t mapping should be used instead of normal t2g mapping. t2t mapping can be easily obtained by replacing the gene col in t2g file with the transcripts.

In the rest of the tutorial, we assume RNA-seq data aligned to the transcriptome using Salmon or Alevin-fry. 

### Step 2.1: Single-cell clustering after alevin-fry

For single-cell data, after pseudoalignment, we need to process the data and obtain a barcodes-to-clusters/cell_types CSV file with rows in the format 'barcode,cluster/cell_type'. 
There are different single-cell analysis tools that can achieve this goal. For example, Seurat or Scanpy. Any analysis tool will work as long as the barcodes-to-clusters/cell_types CSV file is provided. 
For our analysis, we used Scanpy; a tutorial for cell clustering with Scanpy can be found at https://scanpy.readthedocs.io/en/stable/tutorials/basics/clustering.html. 
After clustering and cell labeling, the barcodes-to-clusters/cell_types can be exported as 
`adata.obs[['cell_barcodes', 'cluster_name']].to_csv('barcode_to_cluster.csv', index = False, header = None)` 



### Step 3.1: tealeaf clustering for bulk or pseudobulk data

For this step, we assume the data we are processing are bulk or pseudobulk data, we will need the file generated from step 1, the file path and the name for the isoform quantification files generated by Salmon, and the transcriptome annotation


Sample run:
```
python tealeaf_clustering --map transcript_intron_map.tsv --count_files quantification_files.txt --connect_file intron_exon_connectivity.tsv -a gencode.v45.annotation.gtf --cluster_def 3 \
                                --normalization True -o sample_run_ --minclucounts 30 --mincluratio 0.01
```


Two main output files will be obtained:
- {outprefix}refined_cluster
- {outprefix}ratio_count

sample {out_prefix}refined_cluster
```
sample1.sf sample2.sf sample3.sf sample4.sf sample5.sf sample6.sf
chr1:17055:17233:clu_1 21.1 13 18 20 17 12 
chr1:17055:17606:clu_1 4 11.4 12 7 2 0 5 
chr1:17368:17606:clu_1 127 132 128 55 93 90 68 
chr1:668593:668687:clu_2 3 11.3 1 3 4 4 8 
chr1:668593:672093:clu_2 11 16 23 2.5 3 20 9
```

These two files are equivalent to Leafcutter clustering numers.counts.gz and counts.gz. It is worth noticing that the normalized count or TPM is not necessarily an integer, but the normalized count will exhibit a count-like property.



### Step 3.2: tealeaf clustering for single-cell data

For this step, we assume the data we are processing are single-cell data. Results from Step 2 and Step 2.1 were obtained. The files required for this step will be 1. the salmon/alevin directory that contains files `gene_eqclass.txt.gz`, `geqc_counts.mtx`, and other relevant files from alevin-fry 2. Directory for where the mapping were generated by tealeaf-map 3. the reference that salmon use to generate the index 4. a barcode to cluster file or barcodes to pseudobulk sample file. 

Other parameters are optional. 

Sample run:
```
tealeaf-sc --alevin_dir salmon/out_permit_know/quant_spliceu_t2t --salmon_ref salmon_index/spliceu.fa --ref_dir tealeaf_map_dir
                    --barcodes_cluster barcodes_clusters.txt  --cluster_def 3 --normalization True --preprocessed False -o sample_run_
                    --minclucounts 30 --mincluratio 0.01 -n 100
```

Similar to tealeaf-cluster, two main output files will be obtained:
- {outprefix}refined_cluster
- {outprefix}ratio_count

This step will also generate other relevant files like `barcodes_pseudobulk.txt` that record each step of the computation.




### Step 4:
The output from step 3 is equivalent to results from leafcutter clustering, and the results are compatible with downstream analysis for Leafcutter, such as Leafcutter_ds and Leafviz.
